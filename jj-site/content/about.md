**About Me**

I am a [Digital History](https://www.clemson.edu/cah/academics/history-and-geography/graduate/digital-history-phd/) PhD Student at Clemson University specializing in Southern History from 1860 to 1930. My research focuses on textile mill culture and child labor, exploring the industrial transformations that shaped Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina communities. I currently work as a Metadata Specialist at [Clemson Libraries](https://libraries.clemson.edu/), where I leverage digital history and metadata tools to preserve and make historical materials accessible.

Born and raised in Western North Carolina, the Appalachian Mountains fostered my deep connection to the past and a love for the region’s history. My research focuses on preserving the narratives of mill workers and their families, exploring their resilience and societal impact during the pivotal era of 1860 to 1930. Through my work at the [Piedmont Historical Preservation Society](https://piedmonthistoricalpreservationsociety.org/) in Piedmont,South Carolina and [Clemson University’s Special Collections and Archives](https://libraries.clemson.edu/specialcollections/), I engage with invaluable resources that bring these histories to life. As my project progresses I am building a website [Woven Memories](https://wovenmemories.org/) dedicated to the Textile Industry in the South. It currently focuses on Greenville County, SC but in time I plan to expand it to Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina counties.
