### **Welcome!**

---

As a library professional and Digital History PhD Student at Clemson University, I am deeply committed to preserving historical narratives and supporting archival research. My work focuses on Southern History from 1860 to 1930, with a particular interest in textile mill culture and the transformative role of child labor in shaping Upstate South Carolina and Western North Carolina communities.

Through my blog, I aim to share insights from my research and discoveries in the field, as well as reflections on the critical importance of archives in preserving the stories of past generations.
