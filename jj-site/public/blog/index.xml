&lt;p&gt;I recently traveled to Piedmont, South Carolina to view a school notebook of
a boy who worked in the mills. It is so difficult to find actual primary sources
that speak from the child&amp;rsquo;s point of view. But when I arrived I found so much
more. This is a group working towards opening a museum dedicated to the rich
history of how the textile industry shaped their little town. When you first
enter the research room you find yourself in a room packed with artifacts from
the mill town in the early 20th century. There is just so much to see. The
archive is only opened on Tuesdays but it is open for research. Not only are
there amazing artifacts to view, but they are in the process of archiving the
massive amount of documents from millworkers, and the mill. Not only is there
work on the archive and museum but also a food bank,for locals in the former
mill building. I intend to return of course the collection is offers so many
directions on researching Textiles and how they impacted this small South Carolina
town.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
